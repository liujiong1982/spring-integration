= Security in Spring Integration

[[security-intro]]
== Introduction

Spring Integration builds upon the http://static.springframework.org/spring-security/site/[Spring Security project] to enable role based security checks to be applied to channel send and receive invocations.

[[securing-channels]]
== Securing channels

Spring Integration provides the interceptor `ChannelSecurityInterceptor`, which extends `AbstractSecurityInterceptor` and intercepts send and receive calls on the channel. Access decisions are then made with reference to a `ChannelSecurityMetadataSource` which provides the metadata describing the send and receive access policies for certain channels. The interceptor requires that a valid `SecurityContext` has been established by authenticating with Spring Security. See the Spring Security reference documentation for details.

Namespace support is provided to allow easy configuration of security constraints. This consists of the secured channels tag which allows definition of one or more channel name patterns in conjunction with a definition of the security configuration for send and receive. The pattern is a `java.util.regexp.Pattern`. [source,xml]

 By default the secured-channels namespace element expects a bean named *authenticationManager* which implements `AuthenticationManager` and a bean named *accessDecisionManager* which implements `AccessDecisionManager`. Where this is not the case references to the appropriate beans can be configured as attributes of the *secured-channels* element as below. [source,xml]
----
<int-security:secured-channels access-decision-manager="customAccessDecisionManager"
                              authentication-manager="customAuthenticationManager">
    <int-security:access-policy pattern="admin.*" send-access="ROLE_ADMIN"/>
    <int-security:access-policy pattern="user.*" receive-access="ROLE_USER"/>
</int-security:secured-channels>
  
----

Starting with *version 4.0*, the same configuration is available when using `@Configuration` classes, by declaring a `ChannelSecurityInterceptorFactoryBean`. This class delegates all options for the `ChannelSecurityInterceptor` with a *builder* pattern:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableIntegration
public class ContextConfiguration {

	@Autowired
	private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;

	@Autowired
	private AccessDecisionManager accessDecisionManager;

	@Bean
	public ChannelSecurityInterceptorFactoryBean channelSecurityInterceptor() {
		return new ChannelSecurityInterceptorFactoryBean()
				.authenticationManager(this.authenticationManager)
				.accessDecisionManager(this.accessDecisionManager)
				.accessPolicy("admin.*", "ROLE_ADMIN")
				.accessPolicy("user.*", null, "ROLE_USER");
	}
}
----

NOTE: The `@EnableIntegration` annotation is required to provide the Spring Integration infrastructure (including Security) to the Application Context. In addition this `FactoryBean` falls back to `AuthenticationManager` and `AccessDecisionManager` beans with names `authenticationManager` and `accessDecisionManager` respectively, if they aren't provided in the `ChannelSecurityInterceptorFactoryBean` bean definition.
