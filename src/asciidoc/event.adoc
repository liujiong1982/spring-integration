= Spring ApplicationEvent Support

Spring Integration provides support for inbound and outbound `ApplicationEvents` as defined by the underlying Spring Framework. For more information about Spring's support for events and listeners, refer to the http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/beans.html#context-functionality-events[Spring Reference Manual].

== Receiving Spring ApplicationEvents

To receive events and send them to a channel, simply define an instance of Spring Integration's `ApplicationEventListeningMessageProducer`. This class is an implementation of Spring's `ApplicationListener` interface. By default it will pass all received events as Spring Integration Messages. To limit based on the type of event, configure the list of event types that you want to receive with the 'eventTypes' property. If a received event has a Message instance as its 'source', then that will be passed as-is. Otherwise, if a SpEL-based "payloadExpression" has been provided, that will be evaluated against the ApplicationEvent instance. If the event's source is not a Message instance and no "payloadExpression" has been provided, then the ApplicationEvent itself will be passed as the payload.

For convenience namespace support is provided to configure an `ApplicationEventListeningMessageProducer` via the *inbound-channel-adapter* element. [source,xml]
----
<int-event:inbound-channel-adapter channel="eventChannel" 
                                   error-channel="eventErrorChannel"
                                   event-types="example.FooEvent, example.BarEvent"/>

<int:publish-subscribe-channel id="eventChannel"/>
----

 In the above example, all Application Context events that match one of the types specified by the 'event-types' (optional) attribute will be delivered as Spring Integration Messages to the Message Channel named 'eventChannel'. If a downstream component throws an exception, a MessagingException containing the failed message and exception will be sent to the channel named 'eventErrorChannel'. If no "error-channel" is specified and the downstream channels are synchronous, the Exception  will be propagated to the caller.

[[applicationevent-outbound]]
== Sending Spring ApplicationEvents

To send Spring `ApplicationEvents`, create an instance of the `ApplicationEventPublishingMessageHandler` and register it within an endpoint. This implementation of the `MessageHandler` interface also implements Spring's `ApplicationEventPublisherAware` interface and thus acts as a bridge between Spring Integration Messages and `ApplicationEvents`.

For convenience namespace support is provided to configure an `ApplicationEventPublishingMessageHandler` via the *outbound-channel-adapter* element. [source,xml]
----
<int:channel id="eventChannel"/>

<int-event:outbound-channel-adapter channel="eventChannel"/>
----

 If you are using a PollableChannel (e.g., Queue), you can also provide *poller* as a sub-element of the *outbound-channel-adapter* element. You can also optionally provide a *task-executor* reference for that poller. The following example demonstrates both. [source,xml]
----
<int:channel id="eventChannel">
  <int:queue/>
</int:channel>

<int-event:outbound-channel-adapter channel="eventChannel">
  <int:poller max-messages-per-poll="1" task-executor="executor" fixed-rate="100"/>
</int-event:outbound-channel-adapter>

<task:executor id="executor" pool-size="5"/>
----

 In the above example, all messages sent to the 'eventChannel' channel will be published as ApplicationEvents to any relevant ApplicationListener instances that are registered within the same Spring ApplicationContext. If the payload of the Message is an ApplicationEvent, it will be passed as-is. Otherwise the Message itself will be wrapped in a MessagingEvent instance.
