== Introduction

Spring Integration provides Channel Adapters for receiving and sending messages using the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The following adapters are available: 
	        
Inbound Channel Adapter

			
Outbound Channel Adapter

			
Inbound Gateway

			
Outbound Gateway

Spring Integration also provides a point-to-point Message Channel as well as a publish/subscribe Message Channel backed by AMQP Exchanges and Queues.

In order to provide AMQP support, Spring Integration relies on Spring AMQP (http://www.springsource.org/spring-amqp[http://www.springsource.org/spring-amqp]) which "applies core Spring concepts to the development of AMQP-based messaging solutions". Spring AMQP provides similar semantics as Spring JMS (http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jms.html[http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jms.html]).

Whereas the provided AMQP Channel Adapters are intended for unidirectional Messaging (send or receive) only, Spring Integration also provides inbound and outbound AMQP Gateways for request/reply operations.

TIP: Please familiarize yourself with the reference documentation of the Spring AMQP project as well. It provides much more in-depth information regarding Spring's integration with AMQP in general and RabbitMQ in particular.

 You can find the documentation at: http://static.springsource.org/spring-amqp/reference/html/[http://static.springsource.org/spring-amqp/reference/html/]

IMPORTANT: Even though the Spring Integration JMS and AMQP support is very similar, important differences exist. The JMS Inbound Channel Adapter is using a JmsDestinationPollingSource under the covers and expects a configured Poller. The AMQP Inbound Channel Adapter on the other side uses a `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` and is message driven. In that regard it is more similar to the JMS Message Driven Channel Adapter.

See the note in <<amqp-inbound-channel-adapter>> about configuring the `listener-container` attribute.

[[amqp-inbound-ack]]
== Inbound Endpoint Acknowledge Mode

By default the inbound endpoints use acknowledge mode `AUTO`, which means the container automatically *acks* the message when the downstream integration flow completes (or a message is handed off to another thread using a `QueueChannel` or `ExecutorChannel`). Setting the mode to `NONE` configures the consumer such that acks are not used at all (the broker automatically acks the message as soon as it is sent). Setting the mode to `MANUAL` allows user code to ack the message at some other point during processing. To support this, with this mode, the endpoints provide the `Channel` and `deliveryTag` in the `amqp_channel` and `amqp_deliveryTag` headers respectively.

You can perform any valid rabbit command on the `Channel` but, generally, only `basicAck` and `basicNack` (or `basicReject`) would be used. In order to not interfere with the operation of the container, you should not retain a reference to the channel and just use it in the context of the current message.

NOTE: Since the `Channel` is a reference to a "live" object, it cannot be serialized and will be lost if a message is persisted.

This is an example of how you might use `MANUAL` acknowledgement:

[source,java]
----
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "foo", outputChannel = "bar")
public Object handle(@Payload String payload, @Header(AmqpHeaders.CHANNEL) Channel channel,
        @Header(AmqpHeaders.DELIVERY_TAG) Long deliveryTag) throws Exception {

    // Do some processing

    if (allOK) {
        channel.basicAck(deliveryTag, false);

        // perhaps do some more processing

    }
    else {
        channel.basicNack(deliveryTag, false, true);
    }
    return someResultForDownStreamProcessing;
}

NOTE: Prior to Spring Integration 2.2, and Spring AMQP 1.1, the outbound gateway used a new, temporary, reply queue for each request. This is still the default, but now the RabbitTemplate can be configured with a specific queue for replies; headers are added to the outbound message for request/reply correlation. It is important that the consuming application returns these headers unchanged. The headers are `spring_reply_correlation` and `spring_reply_to`. If the consuming application is a Spring Integration application, these headers will be managed automatically, including the case where that application might send a request/reply to a third application using an outbound gateway.

IMPORTANT: The underlying `AmqpTemplate` has a default `replyTimeout` of 5 seconds. If you require a longer timeout, it must be configured on the `template`.

== AMQP Backed Message Channels

There are two Message Channel implementations available. One is point-to-point, and the other is publish/subscribe. Both of these channels provide a wide range of configuration attributes for the underlying AmqpTemplate and SimpleMessageListenerContainer as you have seen on the Channel Adapters and Gateways. However, the examples we'll show here are going to have minimal configuration. Explore the XML schema to view the available attributes.

A point-to-point channel would look like this: [source,xml]
----
<int-amqp:channel id="p2pChannel"/>
----

 Under the covers a Queue named "si.p2pChannel" would be declared, and this channel will send to that Queue (technically by sending to the no-name Direct Exchange with a routing key that matches this Queue's name). This channel will also register a consumer on that Queue. If for some reason, you want the Queue to be "pollable" instead of message-driven, then simply provide the "message-driven" flag with a value of false: [source,xml]
----
<int-amqp:channel id="p2pPollableChannel"  message-driven="false"/>
----

A publish/subscribe channel would look like this: [source,xml]
----
<int-amqp:publish-subscribe-channel id="pubSubChannel"/>
----

 Under the covers a Fanout Exchange named "si.fanout.pubSubChannel" would be declared, and this channel will send to that Fanout Exchange. This channel will also declare a server-named exclusive, autodelete, non-durable Queue and bind that to the Fanout Exchange while registering a consumer on that Queue to receive Messages. There is no "pollable" option for a publish-subscribe-channel; it must be message-driven.

== AMQP Message Headers

The Spring Integration AMPQ Adapters will map standard AMQP properties automatically. These properties will be copied by default to and from Spring Integration `MessageHeaders` using the http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/amqp/support/DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper.html[DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper].

Of course, you can pass in your own implementation of AMQP specific header mappers, as the adapters have respective properties to support that.

Any user-defined headers within the AMQP http://static.springsource.org/spring-amqp/api/org/springframework/amqp/core/MessageProperties.html[MessageProperties] will NOT be copied to or from an AMQP Message, unless explicitly specified by the *requestHeaderNames* and/or *replyHeaderNames* properties of the `DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper`.

TIP: When mapping user-defined headers, the values can also contain simple wildcard patterns (e.g. "foo*" or "*foo") to be matched. For example, if you need to copy all user-defined headers simply use the wild-card character '*'.

Class http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/amqp/AmqpHeaders.html[AmqpHeaders] identifies the default headers that will be used by the `DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper`:

amqp_appId

			
amqp_clusterId

			
amqp_contentEncoding

			
amqp_contentLength

			
content-type

			
amqp_correlationId

			
amqp_deliveryMode

			
amqp_deliveryTag

			
amqp_expiration

			
amqp_messageCount

			
amqp_messageId

			
amqp_receivedExchange

			
amqp_receivedRoutingKey

== AMQP Samples

To experiment with the AMQP adapters, check out the samples available in the Spring Integration Samples Git repository at:

https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration-samples[https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration-samples]

    

Currently there is one sample available that demonstrates the basic functionality of the Spring Integration AMQP Adapter using an Outbound Channel Adapter and an Inbound Channel Adapter. As AMQP Broker implementation the sample uses RabbitMQ (http://www.rabbitmq.com/[http://www.rabbitmq.com/]).

NOTE: In order to run the example you will need a running instance of RabbitMQ. A local installation with just the basic defaults will be sufficient. For detailed RabbitMQ installation procedures please visit: http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html[http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html]

Once the sample application is started, you enter some text on the command prompt and a message containing that entered text is dispatched to the AMQP queue. In return that message is retrieved via Spring Integration and then printed to the console.

The image belows illustrates the basic set of Spring Integration components used in this sample.
